# Module 12 Report: Evaluating ML Models for Identifying Borrower Creditworthiness

## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
